This example has three Container components, each of which wraps a Typography component. The Typography component is used to render text in Material-UI applications.

This example uses small (sm), medium (md), and large (lg).

The Container component gives you control over how your page elements grow horizontally. They're also responsive, so your layouts will be updated as the screen dimensions change.

## Resumen

```js
<Container maxWidth="sm">
<Typography style={textStyle}>sm</Typography>
}
```
